## Getting Started

- [Create your first Node.js function](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/create-first-function-vs-code-node)
- [Node.js developer guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-reference-node)
- [Language Extensibility Wiki](https://github.com/Azure/azure-webjobs-sdk-script/wiki/Language-Extensibility)

## Contributing

- Clone the repository locally and open in VS Code
- Run "Extensions: Show Recommended Extensions" from the [command palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette) and install all extensions listed under "Workspace Recommendations"
- Run `npm install` and `npm run build`
- Create or open a local function app to test with
- In the local function app, add the following settings to your "local.settings.json" file or configure them directly as environment variables
  - `languageWorkers__node__workerDirectory`: `<path to the root of this repository>`
  - `languageWorkers__node__arguments`: `--inspect`
    > 💡 Tip #1: Set `logging__logLevel__Worker` to `debug` if you want to view worker-specific logs in the output of `func start`

    > 💡 Tip #2: If you need to debug worker initialization, use `--inspect-brk` instead of `--inspect`. Just keep in mind you need to attach the debugger within 30 seconds or the host process will timeout.
- Start the local function app (i.e. run `func start` or press <kbd>F5</kbd>)
- Back in the worker repository, press <kbd>F5</kbd> and select the process for your running function app
- Before you submit a PR, run `npm run lint` and `npm test` and fix any issues. If you want to debug the tests, switch your [launch profile](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging) in VS Code to "Launch Unit Tests" and press <kbd>F5</kbd>.

## Repositories

These are the most important GitHub repositories that make up the Node.js experience on Azure Functions:

- [azure-functions-nodejs-library](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-nodejs-library): The `@azure/functions` [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/functions) that you include in your app.
- [azure-functions-nodejs-worker](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-nodejs-worker): The other half of the Node.js experience that ships directly in Azure.
- [azure-functions-nodejs-e2e-tests](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-nodejs-e2e-tests): A set of automated end-to-end tests designed to run against prerelease versions of all Node.js components.
- [azure-functions-host](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-host): The runtime shared by all languages in Azure Functions.
- [azure-functions-core-tools](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-core-tools): The CLI used to test Azure Functions locally.
